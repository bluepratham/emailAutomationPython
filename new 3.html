Hello All,
<p>After last Fridayâ€™s successful trial, we are trying to fully automate this process.
Please ensure you have the Quality Hour at 12 and update your scorecards at the following location:</p>
<p>%s</p>
Please fill only <strong>numbers</strong> in columns starting with the <strong>#</strong> symbol. Please refrain from typing characters in these columns. Also edit the excel only in <strong>browser</strong>, not in Excel Application.
<p>Please note that there are extra columns to fill this time around (Q-hour summary shared, # utilities & # flows etc.)</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>







Hi, your team %s has missed the muQ deadline. Please update the scorecard on the following link: 
<p>%s

<p>If you're unable to update the scorecard due to some reason, then reply to this mail with the subject '%s Unable to fill muQ' and specify the reason in the mail body. Please copy the subject as it is. 

<p>Note: This is an automatically generated mail that gets triggered every 15 minutes. To stop these mails please either fill your scorecard or reply to this mail with the mail subject as specified above.
